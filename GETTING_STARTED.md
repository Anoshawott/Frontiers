# 🚀 Getting Started with Frontiers

Whether you’re here to share a paper or try out an experiment—you’re welcome.

---

## 🧭 Role 1: Paper Lead
You're sharing a recent paper that sparked your curiosity.

Start by:
- Copying [`frontiers_exploration_template.md`](./templates/frontiers_exploration_template.md)
- Filling in the high-level summary, questions, and ideas for others to explore
- Creating a new folder under `/papers/YourPaperTitle/` and adding your exploration

> You don’t need to build anything—just help us *see the opportunity*.

---

## 🧪 Role 2: Experimenter
You want to build something, test a hypothesis, or answer a question from a paper already in the repo.

Start by:
- Copying [`experimenter_contribution_template.md`](./templates/experimenter_contribution_template.md)
- Creating your own folder under `/papers/YourPaper/experiments/yourname/`
- Optionally add notebooks, code, or visuals under `screenshots/` or as `.ipynb` files

> Start small. Tinker for 1–2 hours. Share what you learn!

## 🧰 Tools and Tips for Beginners

You **don’t need to be a Git expert** to contribute. You can:
- ✍️ Edit Markdown directly on GitHub (click the pencil ✏️ icon)
- 📁 Add folders or files using "Add file" → "Create new file"
- 🧪 Run quick experiments in Colab or Jupyter Notebook
- 💡 Use the templates in `/templates` to keep structure simple and consistent

## 📘 How `CONTRIBUTING.md` Can Help

If you're unsure how to:
- Name your experiment folders
- Organise your contributions
- Navigate GitHub basics (editing, uploading, structuring)

Check out [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — it's your go-to guide for getting unstuck and contributing smoothly, even if it's your first time using GitHub.
