# 🚀 Getting Started with Frontiers

Whether you’re here to share a paper or try out an experiment—you’re welcome.

---

## 🧭 Role 1: Paper Lead
You're sharing a recent paper that sparked your curiosity.

Start by:
- Copying [`frontiers_exploration_template.md`](./templates/frontiers_exploration_template.md)
- Filling in the high-level summary, questions, and ideas for others to explore
- Creating a new folder under `/papers/YourPaperTitle/` and adding your exploration

> You don’t need to build anything—just help us *see the opportunity*.

---

## 🧪 Role 2: Experimenter
You want to build something, test a hypothesis, or answer a question from a paper already in the repo.

Start by:
- Copying [`experimenter_contribution_template.md`](./templates/experimenter_contribution_template.md)
- Creating your own folder under `papers/YourPaper/experiments/experimenter_firstname/`
- Optionally add notebooks, code, or visuals under `screenshots/` or as `.ipynb` files

> Start small. Tinker for 1–2 hours. Share what you learn!
