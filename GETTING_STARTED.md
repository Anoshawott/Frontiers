# 🚀 Getting Started with Frontiers

Whether you’re here to share a paper, join the core research rotation, or try out an experiment—you’re welcome.

## 🧠 Core Team: Rotating Research Leads  
The core research team runs the monthly research cycle, taking turns in the following roles:

---

### 🧭 **Role: Paper Lead**  
You’re sharing a recent academic paper that sparked your curiosity and helping us explore whether it’s worth digging deeper.

Start by:
- Copying [`frontiers_exploration_template.md`](./templates/frontiers_exploration_template.md)
- Filling in a high-level summary, questions, and potential directions
- Creating a new folder under `/papers/YourPaperTitle/` and adding your exploration

> Your job is to **pose the right questions** and spark curiosity—not to answer everything!

---

### 🧪 **Role: Experimenter Lead**  
You want to take the inspiration from the paper and design experiments to test hypotheses, play with ideas, or build prototypes.

Start by:
- Copying [`experimenter_contribution_template.md`](./templates/experimenter_contribution_template.md)
- Creating your own folder under `papers/YourPaperTitle/experiments/experimenter_firstname/`
- Optionally add notebooks, code, visuals, or summaries

> Be creative! You’re here to test what’s possible and share what you learn.

---

### 🤝 **Role: Research Associate (Supporting Role)**  
You’re part of the core team but not in a lead role this month. Your job is to support, question, and offer perspective throughout the cycle.

- Chime in on Teams when leads ask for feedback
- Comment on GitHub discussions
- Optionally, contribute smaller experiments or critiques

---

## 🌱 Research Listeners & Passing Contributors  
Not in the core team this month? You can still tinker, explore, and learn!

### 🧪 Become a Passing Experimenter  
Anyone in the broader Frontiers community can contribute their own mini-experiments based on any open research thread.

- Browse open papers in `/papers/`
- Use [`experimenter_contribution_template.md`](./templates/experimenter_contribution_template.md)
- Add your work to `papers/YourPaper/experiments/experimenter_yourname/`

> Just curious? No problem. Lurk, fork, or tinker on GitHub at your own pace.
