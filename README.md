# ðŸŒŒ Frontiers

**Frontiers** is a playground for curious minds to explore novel ideas from recent academic papersâ€”especially in AI, data science, and creative computing.

Weâ€™re here to:
- Break down complex ideas into simple, shareable formats
- Pose exciting questions that spark creativity
- Tinker and test new methods in quick, low-touch ways

This is for everyoneâ€”from researchers to tinkerers to beginners.  
No pressure to be perfect. Just curiosity, creativity, and contribution.

### ðŸ‘¥ How It Works

Each month, a **rotating core team** of Research Leads explores one paper through light experimentation and open collaboration.  
Anyone in the broader community can join as a **Research Listener** or **Passing Experimenter**, building on what resonates with them.
